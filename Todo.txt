Currently the data manipulation happens in the greekme view vs the component. Component is dumb
on hold - push notifications
Edit profile - Fields in an input list
transform all updates to async !!! update is deprecated, use set now.
sanitize all text coming in.
Settings page for notifications etc


profile image changes size based on picture
Set a post load limit, aka only 10 of the most recent broadcats appear, 20 for feed
Handle event list being empty
slight addition in margin on the bottom of the like badge, use rem instead of px
global accent color, GREY
Make the load screen better, Show gm page for a second (cordova plugins)
look at all cordova plugins and remove unnecessary ones
stacked labels
Event repeat and alarms
fix import on firebase
/// End game
refactor DB with everyone under school
Edit Event tab

update all posts of the user to the new photo via cloud function
Storage link works, however run into an issue with updating when a new picture is put in
look into angular life cycles




A post doesnt store a user's url, that is retrieved from their "user" spot on the DB
Because when a user updated their photo they update their avatarURL
