Problem with having the fcm hook in app component as there might not be a user yet when the app starts up.
push notifications
    Notification drop down
        Change notification icon color if there is > 0 notifications?
        No notification messages when tapping (auto close at 0?)
        Notification has X which removes from a user's notifications
        Sender Name, Broadcast or Feed, message
    Settings page for notifications etc
        User setting for notifications regarding Broadcasts, Messages, and Events
Correct image size generation with ionic cordova resources
event alarms
infinite scroll messed up

Entries are not sorted prior to adding to the map. Need to get all, sort by date, then display.
look at all cordova plugins and remove unnecessary ones
